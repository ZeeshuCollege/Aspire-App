```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **100% Mobile-Only Architecture Mandate**:
> All four dashboards (**Student, Teacher, Parent, and Admin**) are built exclusively as **native mobile applications for Android & iOS**. There is **NO web dashboard**. Every workflow—from daily student timetable viewing to institute-wide administrator enrollment and fee auditing—is engineered directly for mobile screens matching the exact mobile comps in `ASPIRE THEME.png`.
>
> **Core Technology Selection**:
> Built using **Flutter (Dart)**, the premier cross-platform engine ensuring 100% identical pixel-perfect UI, 120fps hardware acceleration, native DRM-light protection (`FLAG_SECURE`), and single-codebase parity across both **Android and iOS**.

### 3.1 Personas
1. **Student**: Enrolled in Std. 9–12, NEET, or JEE batches. Needs daily schedule clarity, test visibility, secure access to study materials, results analytics, and assignment tracking.
2. **Teacher**: Subject specialists conducting offline lectures. Needs one-tap attendance marking, test scheduling, marks entry, study material distribution, and batch performance insights.
3. **Parent / Guardian**: Monitors student attendance, test progress, overall percentage, fee payment statuses, and attends Parent-Teacher Meetings (PTMs).
4. **Admin**: Institute directors and administrative staff. Controls enrollment, faculty assignment, course/batch structures, attendance audits, fee records, and institute-wide reporting.

## 5. Comprehensive Authentication & Identity Architecture

### 5.1 Account Provisioning (Closed Institute Model)
- **Zero Self-Registration**: No public registration form exists.
- **Admin Enrollment**: Admins pre-populate user profiles with:
  - Full Name, Role (`student`, `teacher`, `parent`, `admin`)
  - Registered Email Address
  - Registered WhatsApp Mobile Number (E.164 format, e.g., `+919876543210`)
  - Assigned Course, Batch, or Linked Student ID (for parents).
- **Initial Activation**: Users receive an onboarding notification via WhatsApp and Email containing temporary credentials or an activation link.

### 5.2 Login Modalities

#### A. Manual Email & Password Login (Supabase Auth)
- Built-in Supabase `signInWithPassword({ email, password })`.
- Passwords salted and hashed via Argon2/Bcrypt on Supabase servers.
- Password complexity: Minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 numeric digit, and 1 special character.
- "Remember Me" securely caches the refreshed session token in hardware-backed secure storage (`FlutterSecureStorage` / `Expo SecureStore` / `HttpOnly` cookie).

#### B. Google OAuth (Supabase Auth)
- Direct Google Sign-In button integrated via Supabase Google Provider.
- **Whitelist Gatekeeper**: When a user signs in with Google, an Edge Function / Trigger validates whether the returned Google email address exists in the pre-registered `profiles` table.
  - If registered $\rightarrow$ Auth session granted, user redirected to their role-specific dashboard.
  - If not registered $\rightarrow$ Session terminated immediately with error: *"This Google account is not registered with ASPIRE Learning Centre. Please contact institute administration."*

#### C. Role Selector on Login Screen
- Pill selector for `[Student | Teacher | Parent | Admin]` ensures the UI tailors the login experience, validates role compatibility, and redirects to the proper root navigation stack.

## 6. Password Recovery & Two-Way Verification Flow

Users who forget their password have the autonomy to select between **two secure, zero-cost recovery channels**:

```
                       [ Forgot Password Screen ]
                                   │
              Enter Registered Email or Mobile Number
                                   │
                    ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
                    ▼                             ▼
       [ Option 1: WhatsApp OTP ]     [ Option 2: Supabase Email ]
       (Meta for Developers App)          (Supabase Auth Engine)
                    │                             │
          Sends 6-digit secure OTP      Sends Password Reset Link
          via WhatsApp Cloud API           or 6-digit Email OTP
                    │                             │
          Verify OTP (60s timer)        Click Link / Enter Code
                    │                             │
                    └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                                   ▼
                       [ Set New Password Screen ]
                       (Min 8 chars, strong rules)
                                   │
                       Password Updated Successfully
                                   │
                       Auto-Redirect to Login
```

### 6.1 Option 1: WhatsApp OTP (Meta Developer App)
1. **Trigger**: User selects *"Verify via WhatsApp"*.
2. **Generation**: Supabase Edge Function `send-whatsapp-otp` creates a cryptographically random 6-digit OTP, hashes it using SHA-256 with a salt, and stores it in the `auth_otps` table with a 5-minute time-to-live (`expires_at = now() + interval '5 minutes'`).
3. **Dispatch**: Edge Function executes an HTTP POST to Meta Graph API v19.0+:
   ```http
   POST https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/{phone-number-id}/messages
   Authorization: Bearer {META_SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN}
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
     "to": "919876543210",
     "type": "template",
     "template": {
       "name": "aspire_auth_otp",
       "language": { "code": "en" },
       "components": [
         {
           "type": "body",
           "parameters": [{ "type": "text", "text": "482910" }]
         },
         {
           "type": "button",
           "sub_type": "url",
           "index": "0",
           "parameters": [{ "type": "text", "text": "482910" }]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Verification**: User inputs the 6-digit code into a responsive 6-cell input screen with a 60-second resend cooldown timer.
5. **Validation**: Edge Function `verify-whatsapp-otp` verifies the hash, ensures `used = false`, and issues a temporary recovery token allowing the user to update their password.
6. **Cost Control**: Strictly utilizes Meta's 1,000 free utility/service conversations per month. Rate-limited to max 3 OTP requests per phone number per hour.

### 6.2 Option 2: Email Password Reset (Supabase Auth)
1. **Trigger**: User selects *"Verify via Email"*.
2. **Dispatch**: Supabase client executes `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo: 'aspireapp://reset-password' })`.
3. **Execution**: User receives an email with an action link or numeric OTP.
4. **Validation**: Deep link or OTP handler opens the secure password reset screen.
5. **Update**: User sets a new password via `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword })`.

## 8. In-App Document Security & DRM-Light Architecture

To protect ASPIRE's intellectual property (proprietary question papers, copyrighted study materials):
1. **Direct Download Prohibition**: The mobile and web clients do not provide a "Download File" or "Save to Disk" option.
2. **Short-Lived Signed URLs**: Supabase Storage buckets for `test-papers` and `study-materials` are private. Files are accessed via temporary signed URLs with a 15-minute expiration time.
3. **Sandboxed Viewport Rendering**:
   - Android/iOS: Rendered using native memory-buffered PDF libraries (`pdfx` or `flutter_pdfview` / native canvas).
   - Web: Rendered via Mozilla `pdf.js` inside a sandboxed iframe with toolbar buttons (`#download`, `#print`, `#openFile`) disabled and hidden via CSS/JS parameters (`#toolbar=0`).
4. **Dynamic Forensic Watermarking**: The student's Full Name, Roll Number, and Timestamp are dynamically rendered as a semi-transparent repeating diagonal overlay across the document canvas.
5. **Screen Capture Flag**: On mobile devices, `FLAG_SECURE` (Android) and screen recording prevention (iOS) are enabled on the test paper viewing route.

---

## 9. Non-Functional & Operational Requirements

### 9.1 Performance & Latency
- **Initial Dashboard Render**: Under 1.5 seconds on standard 4G mobile connections.
- **Attendance Submission**: Instant optimistic UI update with asynchronous database synchronization in under 800ms.
- **Offline Resilience**: Offline caching of daily timetable, latest attendance summary, and downloaded study materials for offline viewing inside the secure app sandbox.

### 9.2 Security & Data Privacy
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on 100% of PostgreSQL tables.
- No student or parent can view another student's test results, attendance, or fees.
- Teachers can only view and mutate records for their assigned batches.
- Zero public REST API endpoints; all requests require a valid Supabase JWT bearer token.

### 9.3 Availability & Free-Tier Continuity
- Supabase free projects pause after 7 days of inactivity; an automated weekly health-check ping via GitHub Actions keeps the free project permanently warm.
- Meta WhatsApp Cloud API credentials maintained through a persistent Meta System User with a non-expiring access token.
