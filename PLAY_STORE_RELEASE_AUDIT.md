## 1. Executive Status
**Status:** **READY WITH MANUAL ACTIONS**

The technical codebase, Android Gradle configurations, security postures, permissions, privacy flows, in-app account deletion, reviewer access, and production App Bundle (`.aab`) have been completely audited, updated, hardened, and verified. The remaining actions are manual account setup tasks strictly reserved for the developer inside the Google Play Console web dashboard (e.g. uploading the AAB, entering contact info, hosting the static privacy policy URL, and enrolling closed testers).

## 4. Build Status
- **Vite Production Compilation:** Passed (`vite v6.4.3 building for production... 46 modules transformed. dist/ created`).
- **Capacitor Sync:** Passed (`npx cap sync android` updated assets and plugins).
- **Gradle Release Compilation:** Passed (`gradlew.bat bundleRelease` finished with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` in 26s).
