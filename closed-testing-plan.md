## 1. Tester Recruitment Plan

### Target Demographics
To satisfy Google Play's quality evaluation, testers must represent real prospective users across Android device form factors:
- **Students (6 testers):** Secondary and senior secondary students enrolled in Classes 9–12, NEET, or JEE.
- **Parents (3 testers):** Guardians testing attendance notices, fee records, and report cards.
- **Faculty / Teachers (2 testers):** Educators testing batch schedules, attendance submission, and study material uploads.
- **Institute Administrator (1 tester):** Centre director verifying user provisioning and broadcast alerts.

### Opt-In Logistics
1. Collect Google account emails (`@gmail.com` or Google Workspace) from the 12+ designated testers.
2. In Google Play Console -> **Release -> Testing -> Closed testing**, create an email list named `Aspire-Core-Testers`.
3. Provide testers with the Play Store closed testing opt-in URL:
   - Web link: `https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.aspire.learning`
   - Android Play Store link generated in Console.
4. Verify all 12 testers tap **"Become a tester"** and download the app directly from Google Play.
5. Monitor the Play Console dashboard to ensure the opt-in counter remains at >= 12 active testers continuously without lapses.
